2) object detection pipeline - repaired. Can`t say about complete success, because i was not able to run 18m trainable params model on the systems available. estimated time to do it for one epoch - hours, >10 (colab less ofc, but colab is not 24-7 available).
I downloaded dataset and i am able to run it - it works. Results can be found in output_object_detection_pipeline.txt

   BUT. i've successfully "digged through" all the code and found all 9 bugs.
